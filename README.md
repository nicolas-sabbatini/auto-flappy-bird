# Auto Flappy Bird

## Description
Auto Flappy Bird is a shameless clone of the popular game Flappy Bird, with the twist that is played by a neural network that uses evolutionary algorithms to improve.  
This is my first approach to neural networks and artificial intelligence, so the implementation may not be very "clean".

## Usage
Run the .love file in the bin directory or run the code inside src.
